AI for Science is rapidly advancing, with promising early work on scientific automation‚Äîsuch as DeepMind's [AlphaEvolve](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/) and others highlighted in this Nature [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06221-2).
A particularly exciting frontier is **the automation of AI research experimentation**‚Äîthe process of designing, executing, and analyzing experiments to advance AI itself. Unlike fields requiring physical experimentation, AI research is largely digital‚Äîwell-suited for LLM-based automation. 


  <div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2em 0;">
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Ideally, we want to provide an AI agent with a research goal‚Äîsuch as reproducing a result, validating a new hypothesis, or testing an ablation‚Äî along with the specific context and have the agent:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">‚Ä¢ Formulate hypotheses, design experiments,</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">‚Ä¢ Interpret the associated codebase and identify how to modify it,</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">‚Ä¢ Configure and execute experiments under the right conditions,</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">‚Ä¢ Analyze results and iteratively refine its approach based on findings</li>
    </ul>

Achieving this vision requires benchmarks that evaluate agents in real-world research scenarios. But how do we define those scenarios in a way that‚Äôs representative, reproducible, and gradable?



Intuitively, peer-reviewed AI papers (e.g., in NeurIPS) along with their open-source codebases, offer a rich source of completed experiments that could, in theory, be repurposed to evaluate AI capabilities in research automation. In practice, however, extracting these tasks is difficult. Papers often present a polished narrative that omits intermediate steps, while critical details‚Äîsuch as the precise conditions under which results hold‚Äîare scattered across dense text, supplementary materials, and sprawling repositories.



## Our Contribution: EXP-Bench

To address this challenge, we introduce **EXP-Bench**, a new benchmark designed to make the ever-expanding landscape of published research more accessible for evaluating AI agents in **conducting end-to-end AI research experiments**‚Äîfrom hypothesis to experimental setup to conclusion, as shown in Figure 1. We develop a semi-automated pipeline (Figure 2) that uses multimodal and agentic approaches to reconstruct experiments from fragmented and dense sources (e.g., coding agents identify setups by conditioning on ground-truth outcomes and leveraging the full codebase‚Äîreducing the task to a constrained search), while interleaving these steps with lightweight human validation to ensure correctness.

Using this approach, we distilled *461 experiments from NeurIPS and ICLR papers*‚Äîspanning domains such as vision, RL, and computational biology‚Äîresulting in over 12,000 gradable subtasks.

## What EXP-Bench Reveals About Today's AI Agents

We tested leading agents, including *OpenHands w/ Claude Sonnet 3.7*, and found that while they can earn partial credit for individual steps like experiment design or coding (~20-35% success), their ability to *complete a full, executable experiment* is nearly non-existent‚Äîa mere 0.5% success rate. 
  <div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2em 0;">
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Our analysis pinpointed several critical weaknesses:</p>
    <ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><em>Limited Long-Horizon Planning and Reasoning</em></li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><em>Inability to Handle Open-Ended and Ambiguous Tasks (35.9%)</em></li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><em>Difficulty with Environment Setup (41.3%) and Code Debugging (29.8%)</em></li>
    </ol>
  </div>

These results highlight just how far we still are from our goal of automation of research experimentation. By identifying these bottlenecks and providing realistic step-by-step experiment procedures, EXP-Bench serves as a vital tool for future AI agents to improve their ability to conduct AI research experiments.

## Looking Forward

This work is, we hope, a small step toward our broader goal of designing agents capable of automating scientific research. We see EXP-Bench as a launchpad for the next wave of AI research copilots.

That said, much work remains. While EXP-Bench currently focuses on machine learning papers, it does not yet address domains that require interaction with the physical world or support tasks involving true scientific invention. Expanding to those areas‚Äîand capturing the creativity, uncertainty, and iteration of real-world discovery‚Äîremains an open and exciting challenge.
